 Augmented reality Demo app using Niantic Lightship 3.1 and maps

To Do:

* 'How To' on starting app
* Link between map to VPS
* Show only my VPS
* 'Hint' popups when close to find the VPS
* TAG when VPS has been activated
* 'Puzzle' element connecting tags to complete game element
* Decent graphics / animations throughout(!)


Known Issues:
* Couldn't download a number of files (Bee folder / Android folders) due to their size.
* Used DoTween for the Bandstand code to create a simple dynamic animation which works in editor but not in build.  To be replaced with graphics and actual animations.
* Updated to ARDK 3.1 and map - Render To Texture example that I was going to use no longer works(!).  Bug?
